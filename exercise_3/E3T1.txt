# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
I apology for not having the E3T1_guardduty.png which have findings, because GuardDuty doesn't show finding and I tried many times, couple of hours.
So i screenshot terminal into E3T1_guardduty.png to demonstation I attaked.

I tried like you required and it didn't work. I see on udacity have many people have same problem like me.
I try:
- Activate GuardDuty: Make sure AWS GuardDuty is active for your region in the AWS Management Console.
- Permissions Check: Verify that your AWS account has the necessary permissions to access GuardDuty findings.
- Simulate SSH Traffic: Perform activities that mimic an ssh brute force attack, as GuardDuty needs to observe suspicious traffic to log an event.
- Patience is Key: After simulating the ssh brute force traffic, give GuardDuty some time. It might take a little while to process the events and display the findings.
- Inspect Findings: Revisit the GuardDuty dashboard after a while to check for any new findings.
- Documentation Dive: Go through the AWS GuardDuty documentation for insights on what triggers findings and compare it with your activities.
- Check VPC Flow Logs: If youâ€™re using VPC Flow Logs, ensure they are set up correctly to track the network traffic GuardDuty needs to see.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
